This is a hacked client developed entirely by DaPorkchop_ for use by Team Pepsi. Due to constant requests for a download and an overwhelming lack of time currently, I've decided to open-source the project.

Originally the code was pretty clean, it kinda started to decline in quality after I got the base system layed out. It'll be fixed up soonâ„¢

This was originally sent over the network using the [launcher](https://github.com/Team-Pepsi/pepsimodLauncher), it never worked well so I gave up on this. I'll need to find some sort of autoupdate mechanism now, not sure what to do tbh
